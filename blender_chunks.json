    "topic": "Mesh objects, curves, text, metaballs",
    "content": "Blender supports various object types: mesh (polygonal geometry), curves (Bezier, NURBS), text (convertible to mesh), and metaballs (fluid shapes that merge). Each type has different properties and editing modes."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "2. Modeling",
    "topic": "Edit Mode",
    "content": "Edit Mode allows modifying an object's geometry (only mesh, curves, text, etc.). It is accessed with Tab and allows selection and transformation of vertices, edges, and faces. It is distinct from Object Mode, which acts on the entire object."

    "chapter": "3. Materials and Shading",
    "topic": "Principled BSDF",
    "content": "The Principled BSDF node is a PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) shader that unifies many properties in one node. It is based on the Disney model and allows simulating realistic materials, from plastic to metal, skin to glass. Key parameters include: Base Color (main color or texture), Roughness, Metallic, Transmission (transparency), Subsurface (scattering), Specular / IOR (reflection). It is the default shader in Cycles and Eevee for physically plausible materials."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "3. Materials and Shading",
    "topic": "Shader Node Editor",
    "content": "The Shader Node Editor lets you build materials using a visual node system. You connect input nodes (texture, coordinates), processing nodes (e.g., mix, math), and output nodes (e.g., Material Output). You can combine shaders, overlay textures, and dynamically control properties. It is essential for creating advanced and dynamic materials."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "3. Materials and Shading",
    "topic": "Transparent and Reflective Materials",
    "content": "For transparent materials, use Principled BSDF with Transmission set to 1.0, adjust Roughness for opacity, and enable Screen Space Refraction in settings. In Eevee, enable Refraction and set Blend Mode to Alpha Hashed or Alpha Blend. For reflective materials, set Metallic to 1.0 and Roughness to 0.0 for a mirror effect. Reflections are influenced by HDRI or lights in the scene."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "3. Materials and Shading",
    "topic": "Texture Mapping",
    "content": "Texture mapping allows applying images on 3D surfaces. Use Image Texture + Principled BSDF to link the image.

  },
  {
    "chapter": "3. Materials and Shading",
    "topic": "Bump and Normal Maps",
    "content": "Bump and Normal Maps simulate surface relief. Bump Maps use grayscale images connected via the Bump node. Normal Maps use RGB images (usually purple) connected via the Normal Map node. Both connect to the Normal input of the Principled BSDF and improve visual detail without increasing geometry."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "3. Materials and Shading",
    "topic": "Bump Map",
    "content": "To apply a bump map in Blender, follow these steps: 1. Create or select a material for your object. 2. Open the Shader Editor. 3. Add a Texture Image node and load the grayscale image to use as the bump map. 4. Add a Bump node. 5. Connect the Color output of the Texture Image node to the Height input of the Bump node. 6. Connect the Normal output of the Bump node to the Normal input of the Principled BSDF. 7. Adjust the Strength value on the Bump node to control the effect intensity. The bump map creates a relief effect on the surface without modifying the actual geometry of the object. Make sure the bump image is grayscale, where black represents the flat surface and white the raised surface."

  },
  {
    "chapter": "4. Lights and Rendering",
    "topic": "Cycles vs Eevee",
    "content": "Cycles is a realistic path-tracing rendering engine that accurately simulates light and shadows but is slower. Eevee is a real-time rasterization renderer, very fast but less accurate. Cycles is preferred for final quality, Eevee for quick previews and light animations."

  {
    "chapter": "4. Lights and Rendering",
    "topic": "Render Settings (samples, denoise, ambient occlusion)",
    "content": "Render settings include: Samples (number of rays traced per pixel, higher means better quality), Denoise (reduces noise, available for viewport and final render), and Ambient Occlusion (enhances shadows in contact points for more visual depth).

    "chapter": "4. Lights and Rendering",
    "topic": "Transparency and Background",
    "content": "To make the background transparent in renders (e.g., for PNG export), enable 'Film > Transparent' in render settings. In materials, transparency is controlled with nodes (Transmission or Alpha) and Blend Mode in Material Settings. In Eevee, use Alpha Blend or Alpha Hashed for correct transparency."

  {
    "chapter": "5. Camera and Viewport",
    "topic": "Camera Tracking",

    "chapter": "5. Camera and Viewport",
    "topic": "Compositing",
    "content": "Compositing in Blender involves visually arranging scene elements and is supported by the Compositor, where rendering outputs are combined and modified via nodes (e.g., Blur, Mix, Alpha Over). Visual rules like the rule of thirds, guidelines, and camera placement are used to improve visual output."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "5. Camera and Viewport",
    "topic": "Safe Areas and Focal Length",
    "content": "Safe areas are visual guides in camera view to ensure important elements (texts, objects) do not exit margins in different output formats. They are enabled in the View panel > Safe Areas. Focal length controls the camera's field of view: low values give wide-angle effect, high values telephoto."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "6. Animation",
    "topic": "Keyframes",
    "content": "Keyframes define property values at specific time points. Blender uses them to animate position, rotation, scale, materials, visibility, and more. Inserted with 'I' in 3D View or properties, interpolation between keyframes creates animation."

  },
  {
    "chapter": "6. Animation",
    "topic": "Constraints and Drivers",
    "content": "Constraints impose movement rules between objects (e.g., 'Copy Location', 'Track To'). Drivers control a property using a mathematical expression or another property (e.g., rotation = sin(frame)). Used for automatic animations and complex systems (e.g., rigging)."
